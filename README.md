# Telegram_Digit_Recognition_Bot
A Telegram Bot that, when sent an image of a handwritten digit, replies with the digit in the image and a confidence score (using a Keras neural net).

The neural net was trained on the classic MNIST handwritten-digits dataset, saved and then used within the operations of the Telegram bot.
